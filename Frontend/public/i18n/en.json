        "A1": "Yes, 100%. We do not share your identity with the recipient. They will never know who sent a message unless you explicitly write your name in the message content.",
        "Q2": "Can I find out who sent me a message?",
        "A2": "No. We do not store or reveal information that links a specific message to a real-world identity. This ensures users feel safe to be honest.",
        "Q3": "Why can't I see some messages?",
        "A3": "All messages go through an automated moderation filter. Messages containing hate speech, severe harassment, or explicit threats may be blocked automatically or flagged for review. Currently, 'Pending' messages are not displayed until approved.",
        "Q4": "How do I reply to a message?",
        "A4": "Click on any message in your dashboard to view the full thread. At the bottom, you will see a reply box. You can choose to reply publicly (visible on your public profile) or keep it private.",
        "Q5": "How can I share my profile?",
        "A5": "On your Dashboard, there is a 'Copy Link' button. Click it to copy your unique profile URL to your clipboard, then paste it on Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, or wherever you like!",
        "Q6": "Can I delete a message I sent?",
        "A6": "Once a message is sent, it cannot be deleted by the sender. This prevents users from sending abusive content and then hiding the evidence. However, the recipient can choose to hide or ignore any message they receive.",
        "Q7": "Do messages expire?",
        "A7": "No, your messages will remain in your inbox indefinitely unless you choose to delete your account. We may implement an auto-archive feature for very old messages in the future, but for now, they are here to stay.",
        "Q8": "Can I have multiple accounts?",
        "A8": "Technically yes, but we encourage using a single authentic identity to build better connections. If you lose access to an account, we recommend contacting support rather than creating a duplicate.",
        "Q9": "Is my email visible to others?",
        "A9": "Absolutely not. Your email address is strictly used for account recovery and important system notifications. It is never displayed on your public profile or shared with third parties.",
        "Q10": "What if I forgot my password?",
        "A10": "Since the 'Forgot Password' feature is currently in development, please contact our support team at support@bluntbox.com with your username and registered email, and we will assist you with a manual reset.",
        "Q11": "Can I change my password?",
        "A11": "Not yet! We are currently building the account management features. The 'Change Password' option in Settings will be enabled in a future update.",
        "Q12": "Is there an app for iOS or Android?",
        "A12": "BluntBox is currently a web-only application. However, our website is fully responsive and works great on mobile browsers like Safari and Chrome.",
        "Q13": "How do I report abusive content?",
        "A13": "We take safety seriously. If you receive a message that bypasses our filters and makes you feel unsafe, please contact our support email (support@bluntbox.com) with a screenshot, and we will take immediate action."
